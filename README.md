# Linear classifier

*Disclamer*
*This is a learning project which contains my narritive and was not refined. It's more of a story than production code.*

## Details
- Scalable number of features (test up to 3)
- Gradient Descent (batch)
- Cost function (squared error cost function)
- Regression classifier only
- Manual learning rate (alpha)

## Outcome
Completed in Python, started but not finished in TensorFlow. Instead moved on to my Kaggle competition since it taught me enough about low level TensorFlow fundamentals.
